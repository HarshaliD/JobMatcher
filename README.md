### Objective & Problem Statement
JobMatcher is a career recommendation system designed to help Computer Science students find the most suitable job roles based on their skills and interests. 

Many job recommendation platforms provide generic suggestions, but JobMatcher personalizes recommendations by analyzing resume content, skill sets, and job descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
